# Django REST API Learning Project

This project is a learning exercise to build an API using Django REST Framework. The main goal is to understand the basics of creating API endpoints, testing them, and handling requests in Django.

## What I Learned
1. **Setting up Django REST Framework:** Learned how to install and configure Django REST Framework in a Django project.
2. **Creating API Endpoints:** 
   - Implemented class-based views for retrieving and creating data.
   - Created a function-based view to demonstrate different approaches in handling requests.
3. **Testing the API:** Tested the API endpoints using tool - Postman to ensure correct responses for both success and error cases.
